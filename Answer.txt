# Clay Millennium Problems

What I knew about the Clay Millennium Problems start from Riemann Hypothesis about prime numbers. 
I was hooked into the topic when I was watching Veritasium's video about the topic.
The video told us about until today, we dont know how many prime numbers are there between 0 and x. 
And current known prime numbers found by computer are less than 10^18.
Triggered by that then I found Clay Millennium Problems, which I then knew as the most challenging problems in Mathematics.

# ECDSA

What I knew about ECDSA is that it is a signature algorithm used in Bitcoin and Ethereum, that's it.
I lack of knowledge about the mathematics behind it, and how it works.
But I do know and familiar with the concept of elliptic curves because I've built Solana App,
that requires me bit knowledge about elliptic curves.

Solana using Ed25119 curve for their wallet address. Solana using two types of curve for their wallet address:
1. Off-Curve which is public key that is not on the curve and have no private key.
2. On-Curve which is public key that is on the curve and have valid signature because hold private key.

# Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are currencies that using cryptography technology to secure and verify transactions.
That is why it is called decentralized technology, because it is not rely on any central authority like government or bank.
And they run above technology called blockchain, which is a distributed ledger technology that is used to record transactions.

# Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Zero-Knowledge Proofs is a protocol that allows one party to prove to another party that they know a secret value, without revealing the secret value itself.
Small example:
1. Adit stuck in cave alone and friend Dita is outside the cave
2. The cave have 2 doors of tunnels, Door A and Door B, and only can open using secret key
3. Adit know the secret to open the door and wanna prove to Dita that he know the secret
4. So Adit ask to Dita to shout out any Door A or Door B specifically and Adit will open the door
5. Dita shout out Door A
6. Adit open Door A and Dita can see that Adit is telling the truth
7. Dita shout out Door B
8. Adit open Door B and Dita can see that Adit is telling the truth

# Why I want to work for STG

I dont want to work, I want to learn everything beyond my scope now as a quant trader that build Zirodelta Terminal.
And by joining STG, I can learn everything about trading using knowledge beyond my current scope.
I am dedicated person to learn and improve skill, and I will be totaly work on that.
My daily activity before this is learn and build, impelemting new knowledge into my terminal.
But I dont have mentor in this field, so I believe if I can work under your guidance, 
I can improve a lot and can be best quant trader in your team.
